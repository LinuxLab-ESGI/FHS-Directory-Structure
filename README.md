# FHS-Directory-Structure

A short abstract about FHS used by Linux distros.

Linux is essentially composed of directories et files but every directories have its utility. Whatever Linux distro you are using it is certainly using the FHS (**F**ilesytem **H**ierarchy **S**tandard). FHS defines the hierarchy and all the directorires to have for a GNU/Linux disto and Unix systems.

>A filesystem has two meaning which is generally clear from the context.
>The first meaning is the hierarchy of directories (directory tree) that is used to organize files on a computer system.
>The second meaning is the type of filesystem, it is how the storage of data is organized on the physical disk. Each type of filesystem has its own set of rules for controlling the allocation of disk space to files and for associating meta-data about each file with that file (filename, permissions, creation date, ...)
>Examples of filesystem : ext4, btrfs, xfs, ...
